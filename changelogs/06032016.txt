Changelog for June 3, 2016

Development has been started using the Arduino Uno as the base device.
If nothing else can be done, the ATmega328 will be used as the chip for the project.
The EVM at this time is concieved to have a 16x2 LCD display, an SD card module and
a keypad alongside the enable switch. 

The LCD module uses 6 data lines, the SD card uses 4 and the keypad uses 8. This takes up 18 
of the 20 GPIO pins for the 28 PDIP ATmega328 which is at the heart of the Arduino Uno.
Of the two remaining data lines, one will be used for a pushbutton which will be used to switch
the machine into voting mode. The other line remains free as of now.

The alternative to this design would use switches instead of the keypad for the ease of use.
Of course this has the obvious drawbacks of limiting the flexibility of the machine. 
In that case, there can be at the most 9 pushbuttons which will be used to select a candidate,
while the last remaining data line acts as the enable switch.
