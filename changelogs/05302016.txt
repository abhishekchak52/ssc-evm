Changelog for May 30, 2016

The ATmega16A works with the LCD Hello world program in the bobuino pinout configuration. The reason
for the failure of the standard pinout remains unknown. The chip works best when programmed at 1 MHz 
the internal crystal.

The SD library doesn't work. The readWrite example doesn't write text to a file.
