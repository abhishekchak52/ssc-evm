# ssc-evm
The Electronic Voting Machine for the St. Stephen's College Student's Union Society Elections for 2016-2017. With love from the Electronics Society

The basic design of the EVM is based on the Atmel ATmega328 chip which is at the heart of the Arduino UNO.
The final circuit will use only the chip instead of the entire Arduino board. The code is written in the Arduino language.

##TODO
* Make a working prototype using the Arduino UNO.
* Test for bugs.
* Port to a 40 AVR PDIP chip.
